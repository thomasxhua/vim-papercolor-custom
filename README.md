# PaperColor Custom
Very lazy fork of the PaperColor theme.
- Switched tab highlights around,
- Switched window focus around.

Works with Windows Terminal config for `Moonlight II` and `rose-pine-dawn`.

You need `rafi/awesome-vim-colorschemes`.

Thanks to `NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme` for developing on awesome theme.
